Not to be confused with advanced computation requirements for CE majors. 

To fulfill your advanced composition credit as an ECE major, you have a few options:
- Senior Thesis ([ECE496](ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE496.md)/[499](ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE499.md))
- Senior Project ([ECE445](ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE445.md))

A common option as CE major is to take [ECE411](ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE411.md) to fulfill your design requirment, leaving you to have to find another way to fulfill the advanced composition requirement. 

Here are some good (easy, low-effort) classes:
- BTW 261
- BTW 250
